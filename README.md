# N-Queens Problem Visualization

This project visualizes the classic N-Queens problem using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Overview

The project utilizes web technologies to:
- Display an interactive N×N chessboard.
- Implement an algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem.
- Visualize the placement of queens step-by-step.

## Features

- **Chessboard Visualization**: HTML and CSS are used to create the chessboard grid.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: JavaScript drives the algorithm to find and display solutions.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Each step of the algorithm is visually represented to show how queens are placed on the board.

## Algorithm Details

The solution adheres to these principles:
- No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
- Queens can attack in all 8 directions, which is considered when placing each queen.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the visualization.
2. Interact with the chessboard to see how queens are placed step-by-step.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the project or fix any issues, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
